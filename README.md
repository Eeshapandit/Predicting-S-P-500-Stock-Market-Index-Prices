# Predicting-S-P-500-Stock-Market-Index-Prices

As a **Rutgers Business School graduate** with a strong foundation in **data analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling**, I developed this project to predict the price of the **S&P 500 stock market index**. This project showcases my ability to handle large-scale financial data, build predictive models, and apply backtesting techniques to improve forecasting accuracy—skills that align with data-driven decision-making.  

## **Project Overview**  
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict the price movements of the **S&P 500 index** using historical market data and machine learning techniques.  

### **Project Steps**  
- **Data Collection & Processing:** Retrieved historical S&P 500 stock data using `yfinance` and prepared it for analysis.  
- **Initial Machine Learning Model:** Developed a predictive model to estimate future index prices.  
- **Backtesting & Model Evaluation:** Implemented a **backtesting framework** to assess model performance.  
- **Model Optimization:** Improved accuracy through **feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced predictive algorithms**.  

## **Skills Demonstrated**  
- **Financial Data Analysis & Visualization**  
- **Machine Learning (Regression & Time-Series Forecasting)**  
- **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, yfinance)**  
- **Backtesting & Performance Evaluation**  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**  

### **File Overview:**  
- `market_prediction.ipynb` – Contains all code for data extraction, modeling, and evaluation.  

## **Local Setup**  
To replicate this project, install the following:  

### **Installation**  
- JupyterLab  
- Python 3.8+  
- Required Packages:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `yfinance`  
  - `scikit-learn`  

## **Data Collection**  
All market data is sourced and downloaded dynamically using the `yfinance` package, ensuring up-to-date stock information for model training and testing.
